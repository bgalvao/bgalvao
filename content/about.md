I am an MLOps Platform Engineer and have extensive experience in Data Science; writing support tools; Linux; and Docker. I have an academic background in Economics and Advanced Analytics and am looking for an opportunity to integrate in a team that cooperates in code and infrastructure design in a view to implement end-to-end Machine Learning based systems to solve business problems. My experience covers a wide range of data science topics and have demonstrated concern in streamlining Data Science and Machine Learning workflows by writing software.
